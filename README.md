The problem we are approaching is analyzing and quantifying the change in Mondrian’s art style particularly in how his work shifts from more realistic art to abstract art later in his career. The data we are using to analyze Mondrian’s art style will be images of his paintings collected from various websites such as Artnome and other online art repositories as well as collecting the metadata on each painting including the title, date of creation and dimensions. 

This data is appropriate for our analysis as we are looking to quantify Mondrian’s style over time so having a large dataset with as many of his works as possible will be important in doing statistical analysis based on different quantifications that we can gather from his works. Furthermore, having the metadata is necessary as we are interested in witnessing the evolution of Mondrian’s art style so we can graph statistics by year on a timeline which will make changes more apparent. The title and dimensions of the work may also provide insight that has not been explore in studies we have read up on such as if certain keyword such as objects in the title’s can be identified in the image where the lack of identifiable matching objects may indicate more abstract works as well. The dimensions may also lead to indications of abstraction or at the very least an evolution is his work as the sample of works we have been exposed to show Mondrian shifting away from the landscape portraits in his early work to more vertical or uniform in height and width.

Problems we may encounter with the data mainly come from the lack of quality sources as available images may be of low resolution or poorly cropped similar to missing or generalized data in a table leading to varying degrees of accuracy across the dataset when producing metrics or statistics in image processing. This is mentioned in the Artnome article “Quantifying Abstraction in Art: Mondrian” where they mention issues that arose in their study  “There were some obvious outliers where less complex/abstract artworks ranked high as a result of grainy reproductions” so it may prove valuable to filter out images that do not meet a certain image quality as not to muddy our dataset.

In our readings we have seen two different approaches to analyzing art using Mondrian’s paintings as well as comparing them to Rothko’s paintings. In the Artnome study they used a complexity score based on the average of three measures being the color score, variance score and edge score to judge the abstraction of images creating nice visualizations showing how Mondrian’s work became more abstract along his career[1]. Another approach was the comparison to Rothko’s work quantifying the paintings by mapping them on a X-Y axis with the average saturation and average hue of images to show the distribution of each artist’s work however it lacked a temporal element in the graphs which was resolved in a video showing the paintings being put on the graph in order of when the artist created the work[2]. This work is criticized for a multitude of reasons particularly as of the dataset used it seems to have excluded many of Rothko’s works as well as some of Mondrian’s works toward the end of his career causing misleading conclusions to be drawn by researchers as they made certain assumptions or leaps of logic in their writing[3]. Each painting has history behind it as through Mondrian’s life he experienced different art and events which would shape his style and certain articles touch on the events in his life and how they may have attributed to his change to abstraction. I believe this is an untapped resource to be used in our analysis as certain words or a text giving each painting historical context could help distinguish patterns in each phase of Mondrian’s artistic career.

The data I will be using comes from the Artnome public database linked in the article analyzing Mondrian’s work as mentioned “the complete works of Piet Mondrian are available in our public database”[4]. The data will be the images pulled from the website along with their titles and date created, the dimensions will also be added from the image after they are downloaded from the website. Due to some early sketches having the same name, as the works are scraped we will be keeping a list of all titles to avoid overriding files by renaming a file with a number in brackets where the first repeated title for a sketch named ‘Rose’ would be stored as ‘Rose[1]’ and saved in folder categorized by date. Furthermore after these renaming conventions are considered, the modified title, image dimensions and date will be stored in a Pandas DataFrame so when an image is requested, we will be able to pull it up along with the relevant metadata. Although scraping of data from different websites may have to be modified, the rest of our data ingestion pipeline can work properly with other images as other sources should contain at least image names and dates while we can obtain dimensions from the image itself.
